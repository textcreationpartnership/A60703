            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>AS Truth is a moſt pleaſing Object, and grateful to the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of Man, ſo he muſt have a vitiated and depraved Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, who cannot taſte and ſee how good the Churches peace is, nor reliſh thoſe means and meaſures which are conducive to ſo great and eminent an end. For the attainment of which we may be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged to believe the enſuing Plea to be no unfit expedient; upon the conſideration of thoſe Powers and Faculties which ſince the Late Revoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on His preſent Majeſty (whom God preſerve) hath granted to ſo many Wiſe and Worthy Members of our Church, to reviſe its Liturgy, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect our Eccleſiaſtical Polity, and to report ſuch Alterations and Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as they ſhould judge neceſſary for the Healing of our Breaches, and uniting of Diſſenting Proteſtants. A project becoming the forecaſt of ſo Wiſe and Great a Prince, who had ſo much good-will towards Men, as to deſign Settlement and Peace of Earth: But we have winkt too hard to ſee the things which concern them; yea, many there be of that intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Zeal, and fiery Indignation, wherewith they would devour their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries; as to tell us, That tho our pretences be faced with Conſcience, yet they are lined with Schiſm and Sedition; as true, and yet deceivers; theſe, ſay they, are ſuch who ſet up for Peace, whilſt they mediate and forecaſt War in their Hearts; talking of Union whilſt they themſelves break the Bond of Peace, diſſolve the Unity of the Spirit, and deface the Uniformity of the Church Could theſe Men have procured Fire from Heaven, the World by this time had been in a Flame: Nor could our Doom have been any thing better than that, to which the angry Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples would have ſentenced the <hi>Samaritanes,</hi> yea, executed upon them, had not our Saviour reſtrained their Zeal, and rebuked their Paſſion.</p>
            <p>As to our ſecret Reſervations, or Hypocriſie, we only deſire our liberty till they can diſprove our ſincerity, and to condemn us before, is an hard Cenſure.

            <p>We know well that we are bound to be obedient to our Governors, not only for wrath but Conſcience ſake.

But if otherwiſe, then I may try the Spirits, and examine their Commands, that I may ſee whether they agree or not with that Law, which is Superior to all humane Sanctions, and an abſolute Rule of Truth. To do which, I know no better expedients than reading, reaſoning, adviſing, conferring with Perſons of great Wiſdom and Underſtanding, and eſpecially, praying to be led by that Spirit of Truth, which leads into all Truth. But to give a blind obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to every Command of the Magiſtrate, is a Doctrine fitted more for Brutes than Rational Creatures, for we may as eaſily believe that every thing he touches is Gold, as that every thing which is required by him is juſt, and ought to be believed as Truth.

            <p>Now tho we ſhould admit that many may be over-born by too great prejudices, againſt things of this nature, yet I wiſh it might by our Superiours be conſidered, how far notwithſtanding they may be indulged and favoured whilſt they own the Doctrine of the Church, and are very unwilling to make a breach in its Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.</p>
            <p>[In all the Controverſies of Proteſtants (ſaith the laſt-named Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor) there is a ſeeming Conflict of Reaſon with Reaſon, Scripture with Scripture, Authority with Authority, which how it can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt with a manifeſt revealing of the Truth of either ſide, I cannot well underſtand. Beſides, tho we grant, that Scripture, Reaſon and Authority were all on one ſide, and the appearances on the other ſide all anſwerable, yet if we conſider the ſtrange power that Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
<pb n="xiv" facs="tcp:49816:9"/>and Prejudices inſtilled by it, have over excellent Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings, we may well imagine that many Truths, which in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, are revealed plain enough, are yet to ſuch or ſuch a Man prepoſſeſt with contrary Opinions not revealed plainly. Neither doubt I but God who knows whereof we are made, and what Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions we are ſubject to, will Compaſſionate ſuch Infirmities, and not enter into Judgment with us, for thoſe things, which (all things conſidered) are unavoidable] May our Mother the Church, imitate our Father which is in Heaven in the like Charitable Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration and Allowance.</p>
            <p>I thank God I never had any Addiction or Inclination to the Romiſh Faith or Religion, yet have had ſo much Charity for the Profeſſors of it, as not to think they have generally ſinned wilfully againſt their Knowledge, and Belief of the Truth.

How many Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies in this Quarrel have been ruined? How many Garments rolled in Blood (not excepting his who ſate upon the Throne?) What Blood and Treaſure have been ſpilt and ſpent in their defence, can be eaſier lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed than counted?

            <p>I am perſwaded this is one of the provoking Sins of the Conformiſts, That they have been ſo backward of doing what they were convinced they<note n="*" place="margin">See the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face to the Common-Prayer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 34 Article of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.

            <p>They have the ſame Price now put into their Hands. The King in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites them, the neceſſity of uniting Proteſtants againſt the common and implacable Enemy cries aloud to them, the Groans of burthened and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed Conſciences of their Brethren plead with them. But I am afraid they do but <hi>ſurdis canere.</hi> We may ſeek them earneſtly, but they will not be found of us. Nay, I wiſh there may not be the ſame reaſon to believe now, what a Reverend Doctor and Dignitary of the Church hath ſome years ſince declared to the World, <hi>viz.</hi> That they ſeem rather re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to break all in pieces, and hazard our Religion, and let theſe ſad Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, our Diviſions, ſtill continue, than to abate their Rigour in impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing what they may lawfully alter or aboliſh.</p>
            <p>Nay, that which puts ſo keen an edge upon our Complaints, as to cut every good Man to the Heart, is, That this Judgment which hath laid ſo heavy upon us, hath begun at the Church. Thoſe whom God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to be <hi>Fiſhers of Men,</hi> have ſpent their time and pains in gathering up theſe Shells and Pebbles upon the Shore; and (as one well obſerves) have wrangled about them too. But ſuch is the preſent and remarkable Providence of god, that many of the Biſhops and Clergy are plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for that now as to themſelves, they too much ſlighted, and decry'd as Humour and Faction in others. Now they plead Conſcience, and urge it in excuſe for not ſwearing Allegiance and Fidelity to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; to whom I wiſh as large Diſpenſations as be conſiſtent with the Nature of Government and preſent Conſtitution of the Kingdom. But we ever underſtood thoſe things which are deſtructive to the State, to be out of the Queſtion, and beyond the Bounds of it, yea and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty too. It might be ſaid as it was in another caſe, <hi>If they ask this, let them ask the Kingdom alſo.</hi> For as it hath been ever thought, that a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty in ſuch things would be unreaſonable for any Perſons to ask; ſo neither could it be thought in common Prudence fit for Superiors to grant, eſpecially in our caſe, unleſs they can diſpenſe with a new Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution of our former Miſeries.</p>
            <p>But in the mean time, why might not the Yoak of Conformity be lined, and that Burthen eaſed, which hath ſo long gauled the Necks, and grieved the Conſciences of many in the Communion of the Church?

And
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:49816:15"/>indeed, many to this day think, that the Leaves of that Plant might have conduced much to the healing of the Nation in both reſpects, had our Royal Phyſician applied his Preſcription: But inſtead thereof, that Corroſive was provided, which envenomed, but never healed the hurt of the Daughter of our People; inſtead of binding up their Wounds, and mollifying them with Ointment, there was that Vinegar and Gall poured into them, which inraged and rancled them beyond a Cure. His Majeſty ſoon after this interim, or gracious Propoſition (which was but like Lightning before a Thunder-bolt) enacted a Law, which deprived above 2000 of the Diſſenting Clergy (as hath been computed) of their Benefices and Offices, leaving them the Benevolence of their own Party, and Charity of their Friends to provide Bread for themſelves, and ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Families: By which act was required a Subſcription to the Book of Common Prayer, and to give an unfeigned Aſſent and Conſent to all, and every thing contained in it (which was Reviſed and Reprinted with divers Alterations) and to be done too by ſuch a day, upon pain of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>privation: Which time was ſo limited, that the new Copies could not be diſtributed, or what was to be ſubſcribed to conſulted; which hath of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten cauſed ſome to think that the Perſons then evicted by that Law, were not legally ejected; for 'tis impoſſible for me to give an unfeigned aſſent and conſent to the Truth of a Propoſition which I know not; and the Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance in that caſe was invincible, the Copies not being to be procured in time; ſo that the ſeveral Alterations could not be conſidered, or compared with the Rule of Scripture, which all concerned were obliged to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge they did not contradict. To aſſent to a thing I know not is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, and to know a thing where the neceſſary Medium of Knowledge is denied is no way practicable. How then a Man can be diſſeized of his Freehold for not doing a thing which is impoſſible and impracticable, I leave to Men of Law and Reaſon to determine.</p>
            <p>But I ſhall return to the former modeſt and earneſt Requeſt, made to our Superiors of ſuch a Latitude or Relaxation in point of Conformity, as might render the Churches Yoak eaſie and burthen-light, as to thoſe that are in it; giving ſo fair Invitations and Propoſals to thoſe that are without, that though they be not compelled by force, they may be a kind and generous Condeſcention be conſtrain'd to come in: Whilſt the former Methods of reducing the People of this Nation to an uniform Practiſe in the Modes of Worſhip, have proved as unſucceſsful as they were uncharitable, and rather (in many caſes) the Effects of Spleen than Diſcipline.

               <p n="2">II. THE Sign of the Croſs in Baptiſm: This is a Stone of Stumbling and Rock of Offence; A retained Rite in our Reformation from <hi>Rome,</hi> which other Proteſtant Churches thought fit to reject, as a Superſtitious Ceremony and Popiſh unneceſſary addition to the Holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of Baptiſm; nor were they to be blamed when the end for which the Primitive Chriſtians in ſeveral Caſes made uſe of it was ceaſed. They living among thoſe Heathens who deſpiſed a Crucified Saviour, and in a literal Senſe, were Enemies to the Croſs of Chriſt, in oppoſition to which Gainſayers they by the frequent uſe of it let them ſee, that they were not aſhamed of the Goſpel, and that God forbad, that they ſhould glory in any thing ſave in the Croſs of Chriſt. But this Practice did not long preſerve it ſelf from a Superſtitious Taint, the Primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians thinking nothing well done without it; ſuch was their Opinion of it, yea into a direct Idolatry did this Superſtition degenerate, that in ſucceeding Generations it came to be adored and worſhipped, Prayers being by the Church directed to it, as to God himſelf, which <hi>Aquinas</hi> alledges<note n="*" place="margin">cantat enim Eccleſia O crux ave ſpes unica, <hi>&amp;c. 3. q. 25.4.</hi>

A Third thing which hath cauſed ſeveral to ſtumble and fall from us, is the Poſture of Kneeling at the Sacrament of the <hi>Lord</hi>'s <hi>Supper.</hi> We all agree in this, that the utmoſt Humility, Reverence and Thankfulneſs that we can pay to the Almighty for his ineffable Love to Mankind, commemorated in that holy Office, is not the half that is due, the way of payment is only queſtioned. The Tribute of Honour is not denied, though it be doubted by ſuch as diſſent from us, whether the Coin we are preſcribed to pay it in be current. If we agree the ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial part of our Duty, is it an inſuperable difficulty to find a Temper by which we might accord no greater difference?

<pb n="25" facs="tcp:49816:22"/>and Aid of ſuch as labour in the Word and Doctrine; or elſe that ſuch liberty may be granted them on whom neceſſity is laid to Preach the Goſpel, that they may not like <hi>Iſſachar</hi> be preſt above meaſure, and be forced to ſink down under two heavy Burthens of the Desk and Pulpit. Such Indulgence will make the Yoak of the Church like that of the Goſpel, eaſie and its burthen light.</p>
               <p>The Commands of God are not grievous, ſhall not the Churches be ſo too? If not, we may be a willing, but ſcarce in all points can we be an obedient People in the day of our Humane weakneſs. This would tend to ſtop thoſe Mouths which have been opened wide with Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon the Impoſers, charging them with a Deſign, by this means to ſuperſede and diſcharge the other part of Divine Worſhip (if it will be allowed to be a part) <hi>viz.</hi> Preaching the Goſpel, Spinning the Thread of the Common Prayer to that length, as muſt neceſſitate the cutting very ſhort, or wholly cutting off the Thread of their other Diſcourſes, which they conceive as due to the Command of God, and juſt expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the People: Enlarging the Desk to ſuch dimenſions, as either wholly to juſtle the Pulpit out of doors, or elſe croud it up into ſo nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row a corner, as if it were a needleſs Utenſil in the Houſe of God, and piece of Lumber that might very well be ſpared, as the warm Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes of ſome hot-headed Men have too plainly intimated, which hath cauſed many to flee from our Tents, and do deſert our Communion, as too much reſembling the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> who would poſſeſs the People, that a great deal of Maſs is too little, and a little Preaching too much for Edification.</p>
               <p>Such unhappy Wedges have ſome high-flown Men been to ſplit and divide us, though we have been always apt to Sacrifice to other Nets for our Schiſms, being very quick to diſcover the Motes in our Brethrens Eyes, but very ſlow of Heart to believe or diſcern the Beam in our own.</p>
               <p>Common Prudence, and ordinary Kindneſs are ſufficient Arguments, to induce and oblige our Rulers to proportion the Work, to the Ability and Strength of the Workman, otherwiſe he muſt ſink under the Weight, and languiſh under the Fatigue of his Imployment. A good Man is merciful to his Beaſt, he will not ſet too long Stages, nor over drive his Flock leſt it dies; And whether the Metaphor be proper in the Caſe, I'll appeal no further than the Wiſdom and Conſideration of our Superiors: Let them judge, whether the firſt and ſecond Service in the Morning, the Evening Office and Catechiſing, beſides twice Preaching, and Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Pulpit, (for he that hath a double cure can't do leſs) though we ſhould not inſiſt upon the frequent Additionals of one, or ſometimes ſeveral other Offices, <hi>viz.</hi> the Adminiſtration of both the Sacraments, Burial of the Dead, Thankſgiving after Child-bearing; Letters directed from the King, Orders from the Biſhops, ſeveral Canons and Statute-Laws,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:49816:23"/>
                  <hi>&amp;c.</hi> appointed, and which muſt be read? Whether all theſe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as they be enumerated, be a reaſonable Task for a ſingle and meer Man, whoſe Strength is not the ſtrength of Stones, nor Fleſh of Braſs? If any part of the Liturgy (as the caſe ſtands) be omitted, the Law is violated, the Penalty incurred, our Superiors offended, and the Perſon rendred obnoxious to the Malice, or Mercy; that is, cruelty of every Informer.</p>
               <p>But we hope better things of you, our moſt Reverend Fathers and Brethren, and ſuch as do accompany a Spirit of Moderation, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion towards thoſe who have hitherto laboured as in an Iron Furnace; preſt down out of meaſure, and ſinking under an intollerable Burthen: Our humble and earneſt addreſs therefore is, that though our Forefathers made our Yoak grievous; yet now you will make the grievous Service of our Fathers, and their Yoak which they put upon us lighter: If you will anſwer us,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Kings</hi> 12.4, 7.</note> and ſpeak good Words to us, we will be your Servants for ever.</p>

               <p>He that is to be worſhipt with Divine Honour is God, but Chriſt is ſo to be worſhipt; and therefore I believe him to be God.

               </p>
               <p>But that which is a further Ground and Pillar to this Faith which is in me, is the Parity and Likeneſs of that Honour which is given to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Son: And for this purpoſe it was, <hi>that all Judgment was committed to the Son, namely that all Men might honour the Son as they honour the Father.</hi> From whence I argue thus; that betwixt a Creature and the great Creator, there is an infinite diſproportion, for one is finite and the other infinite; but there is no ſuch diſproportion betwixt God the Father and his Son <hi>Ergo.</hi> The Minor is proved thus, where Objects are infinitely diſproportionate and beneath one and other, there the ſame Honour and Worſhip is not to be paid and performed: But the ſame Honour and Worſhip is to be given to the Son which is paid to the Father; therefore they are not ſo different and diſproportionate, for ſhall we offer that to God that we will not offer to our Prince? Shall we pay the ſame Reverence to him that grindeth at the Mill, which is due to him that ſits upon the Throne? Shall we worſhip the Creature with the ſame Worſhip, which we give to the Creator? Wherefore if God command us to worſhip the Son as we honour the Father, we may account it no rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery to eſteem him co-equal to him and co-eſſential with him; which would be impoſſible where there is an infinite diſtance, as there is betwixt God, and the moſt exalted Creature in Heaven or Earth.</p>
               <p>Yet to have this Article of Faith ſpun out and wyar-drawn into too many, and nice Propoſitions by a ſingle Doctor of the Church, and then impoſed upon it, to all Generations upon pain of Damnation, ſeems too ſtrict an Impoſition upon the Faith of Chriſtians.<note place="margin">22. <hi>q.</hi> 1. <hi>art.</hi> 10. <hi>R. ad</hi> 3. <hi>an.</hi>

Were but our Conteſts, about the Form and Rites of Religion, by ſome wiſe and prudent Concordate framed by our Governours, determined and moderated; we need not fear we ſhould fall out about Matters of State; being all agreed to bear out ſhare in the Charge neceſſary for its Grandeur and Defence: We ſhould all ſit under our Vines and Fig-tress, leading a peaceable and quiet Life, when once theſe Bones of Contention were taken out of the way; and Apples of Strife (which they ſay grow upon a Tree that's nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good nor evil) become forbidden Fruit. Beſides we are not ſturdy Beggars, we ask not Talents but Shekels, we only deſire to waſh and be clean from thoſe additions to Divine Worſhip, which we are afraid may defile our Conſciences, and not be ſo well pleaſing to God: Things which the Impoſers tell us are Matters indifferent when abſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from their Authority: But ſuppoſe it ſhould be an inconvenience to take them away; yet ſure ſo great a good as an univerſal Quiet would
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:49816:34"/>be ſufficient to commute for no greater Nuiſance: But we are perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of the contrary from the Reaſons we have alledged, beſides the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities of ſome of the greateſt Prelates and Members of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> viz. <hi>Hooper,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Worceſter, Jewel,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Salisbury, Sands,</hi> Arch-biſhop of <hi>York, Horne,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter:</hi> Why ſhould I again name <hi>Cranmer, Ridley, Grindal</hi> upon this ſubject, who endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to have the Habits of the Clergy as a Popiſh Relique caſt out. The Arch-biſhop of St. <hi>Andrews</hi> ſpeaking in his Sermon at the Aſſembly of <hi>Perth,</hi> did acknowledge, <hi>[That the Conveniency of them was doubted by many, but not without Cauſe, &amp;c.

The Words be theſe, [<hi>The particular Forms of Divine Worſhip, and the Rites and Ceremonies appointed to be uſed therein being things in their own nature indifferent, and alterable, and ſo acknowledged: It is but rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable upon weighty and important Conſiderations, according to the various Exigency of times and occaſions ſuch Changes and Alterations ſhould be made therein, as to thoſe that are in place of Authority ſhould from time to time ſeem either neceſſary or expedient; accordingly we find that in the Reigns of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Princes of Bleſſed Memory ſince the Reformation, the Church upon juſt and weighty Conſiderations her thereunto moving, hath yielded to make ſuch alterations in ſuch Particulars, as in their reſpective times were thought con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient,</hi> &amp;c.] As for weighty Cauſes ſure we never had any more pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous to incline the Ballance then what may now be put into it: Will not the deſire and deſign of our Prince to looſe every Burthen, and break every Yoak from the Neck of Mens Conſciences move? Will not the pious Zeal for Unity and Peace together with a juſt Regard and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion towards tender Conſciences of the beſt and greateſt, of all (I think I may ſay) the Prelates and Governours of the Church move? Will not the moſt deſirable Compliance, and Harmony with our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren of the Reformed Churches abroad, an happy Concord and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with our Brethren at home move? That we may be no longer at ſtrife one with another, that we may take ſweet Council together, and go to the Houſe of God in company, that all Bitterneſs and Wrath being laid aſide, the Lion may eat Straw with the Ox, and lie down with the Lamb: That it may be ſaid of us owning the Chriſtian Faith and Doctrine of the Church, who were not a People in time paſt,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.20.</note> but

Why are we ſo zealous againſt thoſe we call He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, and yet great Friends with Drunkards, Fornicators and Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, intemperate and idle Perſons? Beſides (as that worthy Perſon ſpeaks) <hi>Drunkenneſs,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I am certain is a moſt damnable Sin,</hi> &amp;c. But Sects are made, and Opinions are called Hereſies upon Intereſt: Why ſhould we then ſtrain at a Gnat and ſwallow a Camel? If a Man ſwears by the Temple 'tis nothing, but if he ſwears by the Gold of the Temple he is a Doctor. If a Man commits Fornication or Adultery 'tis nothing, we can hear, pray with, hug and converſe with ſuch an one, though he defiles the Temple of the Lord: But if he conforms not to the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial part of Divine Worſhip, he dinges the Gold of the Temple, he is a Debtor to the Law, and he ſhall pay for it: To theſe we ſay ſtand by, for I am more holy (that is more conformable) than you; boaſting as St. <hi>Paul</hi> once did, that they have profited in their Religion above their Equals in their own Nation,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Gal.</hi> 14.</note> being exceedingly zealous of the Tradition of their Fathers.

In our Reformation many things were retained by the Wiſdom of our Reformers, that offence might not be given to the <hi>Roman</hi> Church. We retained the three Creeds many of their Feaſts, Faſts, ſeveral of their Rites and Ceremonies, Croſs, Surplice, Kneeling at the Sacrament, Form of their Worſhip; inſomuch, that <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth told his
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:49816:35"/>rebellious Subjects, <hi>That the difference of their Service was; that before it was performed in an unknown Tongue, but now in a Language they underſtood.</hi> Had the outward manner of Celebration, been much different from the former, the King would never have uſed ſuch an Argument to appeaſe them, it would indeed have been to little purpoſe: And what good hath all this Compliance wrought, to what end hath all this waſte of Charity been? It hath hardned them in their Superſtition, and given them hopes that thoſe who ſo far complied and ſymbolized with them, might be prevailed with in time to return, ſeeing they dreſſed ſtill their Service, with ſome of the Garlick and Onions they brought from thence. Whatſoever then we have retained not to ſcandalize them, let us now part with to gratifie our Proteſtant Diſſenting Brethren, which will not only oblige them, and render their Separation indefenſible, but will juſtifie us before all the World; and will prove an excellent Balm to cure the hurt of the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of our People ſubſtantially; And will not this move us? I cannot forbear to mention what a late Author (no Non-conformiſt) hath perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently alledged to this purpoſe, his Words are theſe, [<hi>Becoming a Papiſt to the Papiſts, that by all means they might gain ſome of the Papiſts: For this reaſon in her Liturgy ſhe hath kept her beſt Collects, whatever was juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiable in her Litany, and all their Creeds, in her Rubrick many of her Feaſts, moſt of their Faſts, and ſome other of their Ceremonies: But ſince that time</hi> (viz. <hi>the Bull from</hi> Rome) <hi>we have gained none, loſt ſome, whoſe narrower Souls could not ſwallow ſuch things. Now more than an hundred Years ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience calleth upon the ſame Charity to tack about, and ſteera contrary courſe. Its a general Rule, and practiſed by all good Phyſicians to obſerve whether their Preſcriptions do more good or hurt, nor could he be faithful either to his Patient or Profeſſion, that ſhould obſtinately ſtick to his firſt Orders in contradiction to Experience: It hath pleaſed our gracious King to Authorize the Prelates and Repreſentatives of our Church, to practice the ſame Charity towards our diſtempered Church and State.</hi>] Would to God this Author had never wrote any thing more diſagreeable to ſound Doctrine, and the things which belong to the Church's Peace than he hath in this.</p>
               <p>But were your Souls in my Soul's ſtead I could heap up many more Arguments; But all that I ſhall add is an earneſt Reinforcement of our Requeſt, to you that have Power committed to you to heal the Breaches and redreſs the Grievances of the Church; that the Flames which have been ſo induſtriouſly blown up, may now be blown out, and for ever extinguiſhed, that virulent and peeviſh Men may never be intruſted, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Church or State: But that a Spirit of Meekneſs and Moderation may act our Wheels, yea the Wheels within the Wheels, <hi>viz.</hi> The Privy-Councils and moſt ſecret Tranſactions, that a Spirit of Peace and Love may preſide in all our Civil Aſſemblies. And (as the Philoſophers fanci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Angels were to the Heavens) be the great Intelligence to move them.</p>

               <p>As for him, whom the King of Heaven and Earth hath by his mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous Providence ſet over us, and raiſed up to reſcue us from all thoſe Miſeries that were come, and coming upon us. May all the Bleſſings which ever made Princes good,<note place="margin">Hic vir non invidet mihi gratiam.</note> and great light upon him; and as for the eaſe which his Proteſtant Subjects injoy in the free Exerciſe of their Religion we are ſo far from envying it that we bleſs God, the King and Parliament for it: Might but an act of Comprehenſion be joined to that of Indulgence, might the Church Doors be ſet ſo wide, that all True and Orthodox Miniſters and People too might go in and out, and find reſt to their Souls; might but that Project and Platform of Accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which his Predeceſſor <hi>Charles</hi> II. in his Declaration concerning Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Affairs, formerly publiſhed and propounded be once enacted, and ſetled as a Law, we might live to ſee Schiſm baned, Truth and Peace ſetled: It hath pleaſed God to deliver us out of the Hands of our Enemies to ſerve him without fear, might there but be a Temper to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe our angry Friends (and why ſhould we fall out, for we are Brethren) we might ſing our <hi>Conclamatum eſt;</hi> the Work of God would be finiſht.</p>

                  <hi>1ſt.</hi> Theſe Eſtabliſhments and Orders have coſt the Church dear, it once ſunk in the Defence of them, and with it one of the beſt of Kings, that ever aſcended the Throne ſince the Reformation. This was foretold long ſince by a true Prophet: I mean the Learned <hi>Zanchy</hi> in a Letter to Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> 1571. <hi>[Your Majeſty ſaith he being perſwaded by ſome, otherwiſe great Men, and carried with a Zeal, but not according to Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to retain Unity in Religion, hath now more than ever reſolved and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed, yea doth, Will and Command, that all Biſhops, and Miniſters of Churches ſhall in Divine Service put on the white Linnen Garments, which the Popiſh Prieſts uſe now in Popery; yea it is to be feared that the Fire is ſo kindled, and caſt its Flames ſo far and wide, that all the Churches of that

Had it not been better then if the Church had not been ſo tenacious of theſe Rites, to have diſpenſed with ſome of its pretended Beauty and Uniformity, to have caſt ſomething of its Ceremonial Cargo overboard, and to have ſomewhat lightned the Veſſel, than to have endangered the bottom, and ſuffered (as it did) Shipwrack of the whole.</p>
               <p>When the Diſeaſe grew inveterate, and Humors of the Populacy into an extreme ferment, our Phyſicians could have been content to have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied the Remedy, but it was too late.</p>

               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2dly,</hi> If this Objection be admitted, are not all the Deſigns of indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging tender Conſciences ſuperſeded? St. <hi>Paul</hi> the Apoſtle directs thoſe which are ſtrong, to bear the Infirmities of the Weak: To become all things to all Men that we might gain ſome, not to cauſe our Brother to offend: That there be ſome who prefer one day before another, others eſteem every day alike; ſome believe they may eat all things, another who is weak eateth Herbs: What's to be done in this caſe? We muſt not deſpiſe one and other, but forbear one and other in Love, not giving any Scandal to our Brethren; for he that offends his Brother ſins againſt Chriſt: Which Rules of forbearance are as obliging to the Church in general, as to private Chriſtians in particular: But if this Objection carry any force with it, it might be replied, how can this yieldance be; for then, no ſooner ſhall the Church have appointed by its Decree any thing to be obſerved, but upon the pretence that ſome nice and ſcrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Conſcience is offended, all muſt be given up.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <hi>3dly,</hi> Notwithſtanding this Objection, wiſe and worthy Men have judged a Latitude and Liberty fit to be uſed, and practiced in theſe things. The Reply of King <hi>James</hi> to Cardinal <hi>Perroon</hi> (returned him by <hi>Cauſabon</hi>) was to this purpoſe, <hi>That the Church ſhould do well, to ſever neceſſary things which are not many from unneceſſary, and that the latter be left to Chriſtian Liberty.</hi> This was that which the Council of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> had regard to, when they declared that it ſeemed good to the Holy Ghoſt, and to them to lay nothing upon them but what was neceſſary, <hi>viz.</hi> to abſtain from Fornication, from things ſtrangled, and from Blood.</p>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:49816:37"/>
               <p>Doctor <hi>Potter</hi> obſerves, that as the ancient Worthies and Fathers of the Church were moſt zealous to defend even with their Blood, to the leaſt Jot or Title, the Rule of Faith or Creed of Chriſtians; or as the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture calls it, the form of ſound Words, the Principles of the Oracles of God; ſo again they were moſt charitable to allow in other things a great Latitude, and Liberty: Would to God the Fathers and Worthies of our Church would do ſo, and our Work were done.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <hi>4thly,</hi> Decency and Order may be had and maintained, though theſe ſcrupled Rites ſhould be omitted; unleſs we condemn all our Brethren of the Reformed Churches, who have thought fit to lay aſide the Practice of thoſe Ceremonies, which among us have ever ſince the Reformation been a Stone of ſtumbling, and Rock of offence; and that not only to ſome of our weaker Brethren; but alſo to many of the greateſt Biſhops and Prelates of the Church, as I have already hinted; Inſomuch that <hi>Zanchy</hi> in his aforeſaid Epiſtle, told the Queen that moſt part of the Biſhops, Men greatly renouned for all kind of Learning and Godlineſs, had rather leave their Office and place in the Church, than againſt their own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences admit of ſuch Garments which are at the leaſt ſigns of Idolatry and Popiſh Superſtition, and ſo defile themſelves with them, and give offence to the Weak by their Example.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <hi>5thly,</hi> An Abolition of theſe Rites does not oblige the Church to be ſubject to every querulous and teachy Complainant; ſuppoſe a Prince grants the Petition of a Criminal, and gives him his Life for a Prey, will it therefore follow that he ſhall never know when he hath done and that Juſtice ſhall never be executed, becauſe it hath upon ſome earneſt Applications given place to Mercy and yielded to Clemency. The King hath thought fit to annul the Act for Chimney-money, will it therefore follow no branch of his Revenue muſt ſtand unrepealed? Suppoſe the Church ſhould repeal and caſſate the Laws for the Ceremonies, for the Reaſons that have been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, will it therefore follow, that nothing muſt ever be ſetled for the maintaining of Order and Decency: For though it may grant ſome things with Reaſon, will it follow therefore, it muſt yield up every thing without Reaſon?</p>
               <p n="6">
                  <hi>6thly,</hi> If nothing muſt be granted by way of Relaxation in point of Conformity, upon the Reaſon objected, then the Church's Peace can never be ſecured. For more than an hundred Years, <hi>viz.</hi> over ſince the Reformation the Church hath had and ſuffered many a bitter Pang for the ſake of theſe offenſive Rites and Ceremonies, ſhe hath had a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant ſtruggle in her Womb by reaſon of them: They once fretted out her Bowels, and they are again, and have been ever ſince their Reſtora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with <hi>Charles</hi> II. as Moths fretting her Garments. They have been the conſtant Troublers of our <hi>Iſrael;</hi> And I am afraid if with <hi>Jonas</hi> they be not caſt overboard, they will at one time or another ſink our Ship: Though I earneſtly wiſh (whatever be the event of this Eſſay) there may
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:49816:37"/>never be any occaſion to lament the fulfilling of this Propheſie among us; as with bitter cries we have lived to bewail the Fate of <hi>Zanchy</hi>'s: And ſhall we ever retain that Leven that is ſo apt to ſowre the whole lump, ſhall it never be purged out? Oh, that it might once be. <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar</hi> cauſed all the Glaſſes to be broken, leſt the uſe of them ſhould occaſion Blame and Terror to the Servants, and create Strife in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, the thing applies it ſelf, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 'Tis true, we are Brethren, we have the ſame Father, the ſame Faith, the ſame Baptiſm, the ſame Religion as to all the Subſtantial parts of it. Why ſhould we have a Partition-wall built betwixt us? Whilſt we are two Flocks, differences will be apt to ariſe and cauſe the Herds-men to fall out; and what Flames ſuch Sparks may kindle among us, our former Aſhes, and Experience are ſufficient to make us dread the Incendiaries, and Boutefeus. Let us then no longer ſhut our Eyes that we ſhould not ſee the things which concern our Peace.</p>
               <p>Let us now be one Sheepfold under one Shepherd: An Act of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion would effect this: Were the Declaration of <hi>Charles</hi> II. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Eccleſiaſtical Affairs caſt into the Form of a Law, I believe our Schiſm would in a great meaſure preſently, in proceſs of time be totally extinguiſhed: And the hurt of the Daughter of our People, by the Balm which diſtils from it, effectually cured: Which was formerly the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of an excellent and reverend Divine of our Church: I ſhall give it you in his own Words, [<hi>If ever,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>a Divine Sentence was in the Mouth of a King, and his Mouth erred not in judgment, I verily believe it was thus with our preſent Majeſty when he compoſed that admirable Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which next to Holy Scripture I adore, and think that the united Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the whole Nation cannot frame a better, or a more unexceptionable Expedient for a firm and laſting Concord of theſe diſtracted Churches.</hi>] <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith a Man of Underſtanding is of an excellent Spirit, and the worſt wiſh I have for our Mother the Church is, that all her Sons were of no worſe Temper: Then we ſhould have our wiſh, <hi>viz.</hi> one Sheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold; nay what's better, the Unity of the Spirit in the Bond of Peace.

Was it not an hard caſe for thoſe Earls and Noblemen aboveſaid to be accounted guilty of a capital Crime, for preſenting their Petition for a redreſs of Grievances? Nor was it much better with us when the late Abhorrences were in faſhion, by which they had ſo far decried, that reaſonable and undoubted liberty of the Subject; which the late King believing, and that the Sauce for a Gooſe might ſerve for a Gander too, took the advantage of impriſoning and impeaching the Seven Biſhops for a modeſt and humble Repreſentation of their Grievances, which by the Law of the Land they were ſufficiently

               <p>But how miſchievous ſuch extravagant Inſinuations and Councels proved both to Church and State, the enſuing Miſeries were too evident and undeniable Arguments: Nor did the Authors and contrivers of them ſucceed any thing better than others who fell under the dint of them. <hi>Malum enim Conſilium conſultori peſſimum:</hi> For whilſt they thought to oblige and eſpouſe the Sovereign Power to their Intereſt, <hi>viz.</hi> To preſs and puſh on thoſe Innovations in Religion, which they had adviſed his Majeſty were orderly and decent in the Church, and to urge the eſtabliſht Conformity (very offenſive to tender Conſciences) with the utmoſt Rigor; nay in two ſeveral Reigns they Councelled and procured Edicts, to legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate the Violation of the Sabbath-day by Sports and Paſtimes, ſeveral of them fell under the Dint and Cenſures of the Civil Power, feeling the Effects, and unhappy Influence of thoſe Convulſions, they had occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Bodies Eccleſiaſtick and Politick, by regrating too far upon the Humors: I mean the Liberties of the Subject, both as Chriſtians and Men. Have we not reaſon then to plead for an allay, and temper of ſuch Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters as are apt to occaſion ſo dangerous a Ferment both in Church and State?</p>
               <p>But I can't conclude here, ſeeing by theſe wild and extravagant No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions concerning Royal Power, I have been led aſide, and my Pen dipt in this Argument; eſpecially conſidering thoſe vile and virulent Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons made upon our late Revolution, counting all no better than Rebels and Traytors who willingly offered themſelves to reſcue our Liberties and Religion from Popery and Arbitrary Government: Nay the moſt that can be allowed our King (by ſuch as pretend upon ſecond thoughts to be proſelyted to his Service) is, that he muſt be acknowledged ſo rather of fact, than right. But if what hath been already ſaid be not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to vouch the Endeavours of the People in preſerving the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Conſtitutions of the Commonwealth, their Lives and Religion; when they are in eminent and apparent hazard, I ſhall fetch an Argument from a Royal Topick, which I think may ſerve much to vindicate our late Tranſactions. Had Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> King <hi>James,</hi> King <hi>Charles</hi> judged the Defence which the Proteſtants made in <hi>France, Flanders, Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi> &amp;c. of their Lives, Religion and Liberties againſt the Kings of <hi>France, Spain</hi> and <hi>Emperor,</hi> an unjuſtifiable Rebellion, they would never have aſſiſted them, with Men and Money, Arms and Ammunition for
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:49816:43"/>their redreſs, and reſcue from thoſe who by their Sovereign (but ill ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged) Power had ſo far rent and raviſht them out of their Hands. By which Aſſiſtances and Supports, they though Princes themſelves did not only approve their Undertakings in particular; but allow and vindicate the like Practices in parallel Caſes in general.</p>
               <p>But if the Doctrine of Non-Reſiſtance be true in the Sence it hath been preacht: Neither Peers nor People, Lords nor Commons muſt wag an Hand, move a Foot, but ſtand ſtill and ſee the Salvation of God. Let the Pillars of the Church be rifled, the Foundations of Civil and Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Polity raced, and deſtroy'd, the original Contract of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment diſſolved, nothing is to be done but to depend upon Providence, expecting a Miracle to be wrought for our deliverance. Every act of our own in order to that end being adjudged Rebellion. Were the Knife at our Throat according to the Rules of Paſſive-Obedience, we muſt not put it by, if an Angel from Heaven appears not to our reſcue. But never did Men make worſe uſe of a Doctrine they had ſo ſtifly maintained, when it came to their own turn to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice it.</p>
               <p>They proved indeed Paſſive in their Obedience to the Commands of the late King, few or none of them being very active to obey him in the time of his diſtreſs; or to make uſe of the Doctrine of Non-Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, but with reſpect to the Deſign of the <hi>P.</hi> of <hi>O.</hi> ſo that if we may be guided by what they did, and not what they ſaid, we have enough to juſtifie not only our preſent Conſtitution, but late Revolution alſo.

               <p>I ſhall not in ſo great a caſe interpoſe mine own Judgment, it being eaſie to prick our Fingers in ſuch a Thorny queſtion: Yet I may ſay, if any for the breaking of their Yoak have aſcribed too much to the<note n="(b)" place="margin">Though the Biſhop of <hi>Burgen</hi> to prove the Church above the Pope, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued from an unexpected Topick, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to prove the Body of the Kingdom to be above the King: To which <hi>Tho.

                  </note> People, granting them too great a Liberty of conteſting their Rights with their Sovereigns; others in hopes to eſpouſe Princes to their Intereſt in grieving and oppreſſing their Diſſenting Brethren, have beyond meaſure fawned upon and flattered them, till they nurſt up the beſt tempered Monarchy upon Earth, into an intollerable and tyrannick Exerciſe of Regal Power.</p>
               <p>But this is a digreſſion which by purſuing the Extravagancies of ſome Mens Opinions I have been led: In which if I proceed a little further (being once out of the way) I muſt beg the Readers Patience and Pardon.</p>
               <p>For having peruſed the Caſe of Allegiance due to Sovereign Princes (by <hi>W. S.</hi>) I could not but with very much regret obſerve, that in the whole drift of that Diſcourſe we can find little, or none other Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to enforce our Allegiance to King <hi>William, &amp;c.</hi> than what would beſpeak it, for the greateſt Uſurper, and Intruder who hath had the good Fortune to gain an actual Poſſeſſion of the Crown; which looks (to ſay no worſe) very ungratefully upon him, whom the Lords Spiritual and Temporal invited over, and who by the univerſal Conſent, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe of the People, declared by their Repreſentatives in Parliament, was inveſted with the Royal Government, and to whom we owe next to the Divine Providence, all that is dear to us. To reflect then ſo unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily upon him, as if he were no better than one who uſurps the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and that hath no further Right to the Kingdom then what
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:49816:45"/>Power, Poſſeſſion and Succeſs can convey to him; ſeems no way reconcilable to Duty, or good Manners.</p>
               <p>This Author in his Preface tells us, that he never did any thing to cauſe the World to take him for diſhoneſt, or a Fool: As to the firſt, I am very loath to call a Man a Knave without great Grounds for it, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially a Miniſter, upon whoſe Perſonal Reputation much of the Succeſs of his Miniſtry depends. Conſcience I know is a tender thing, and more eſpecially ought ſo to be in the caſe of an Oath. I will ſuppoſe that he acted ſincerely in his Refuſal, and out of tenderneſs to the Faith he had plighted to his former Sovereign, and I hope he hath not acted upon any worſe Principle in ſwearing Allegiance to the preſent Powers, and that he hath not the Perſon of his Prince in admiration becauſe of advantage: For many conſidering the nature of his Argument do think it may juſtly defeat his expectation of a Biſhoprick if he had any ſuch.<note place="margin">

               <p>As for the latter, I mean his Wiſdom, ſomething is to be ſaid for that too; for he who upon the Matter challenges an whole Party of Men to try their Skill with him, had need have his Wits about him. I find his Wit was once commended for refuſing to give an Anſwer to <hi>Antiſozzo,</hi> and the Reaſon which himſelf gave for it was, becauſe he would not make the Diſpute a trial of Wit: But he hath given a freſher Argument ſtill than this, <hi>viz.</hi> That he wrote his Caſe of Allegiance under a juſt and moderate Prince, who notwithſtanding the ſmarteſt Reflections upon him, being ſatisfied with the Teſtimony of a good Conſcience and ſincerity of his Deſigns; did as <hi>Saul</hi> when they ſaid this Man ſhall not reign over us, and brought him no preſents, yet he held his peace. Had he lived in a Reign when Men ſuffered by <hi>Innuendo's,</hi> he might have found it much harder to have defended himſelf againſt an Impeachment, for his Crime againſt the State; than his too late Submiſſion to the preſent Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>The Crowns of Princes are heavy enough of themſelves without the exceeding weight and guilt of Uſurpation, or Intruſion into another's Right being added to them. King <hi>William</hi> would pay dear for his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to purchaſe it at the price of a good Conſcience, and loſs of a far better Inheritance; and the Providence of God placing him upon the Throne will prove no very good Plea for holding the Poſſeſſion of it, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the juſt Claim and civil Right of another: For though the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God may, make uſe of the unjuſt Actions of one to puniſh juſtly the Sin of another; yet the Injuſtice and Violence of ſuch dealings can no way be excuſed by the diſpoſal of an over-ruling Providence, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting bad Actions to work a good End. If a Perſon ſtronger than I by virtue of his Power or Intereſt take away my Goods, God by ſuch means may puniſh me perhaps for my Sins, yet it will be a very inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Plea on his part, before God, or hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

That an abſolute and illimited Power in the State have been planted and watered by the Principles and Practices of our great Stick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers for Hyper-conformity, and Innovations in Religion, hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready proved, by what they have tranſmitted to the World from the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:49816:48"/>Preſs and Pulpit. For whilſt the Wind of Law hath been too ſcant for them to maintain their courſe in Eccleſiaſtical Matters, they have endeavoured to tide it up by the Fluxes of Prerogative, giving the ſame Advice that was once the Opinion of the Flatterers of <hi>Cyrus.</hi> That though what he did was not juſtifiable by Law, yet the Kings of <hi>Perſia</hi> might to what they pleaſed.</p>
               <p>As for the latter, I thank God, I was never troubled with the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing of the Gall: It being a thing always contrary to my Inclination, to have any Man expoſed to the Cenſure of the Civil or Eccleſiaſtical Magiſtrate, when any other Meaſures can be taken to prevent the Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief of his Error: And if our Conſciences do not accuſe us, then may we have confidence towards God, and towards Man too: Though I could have wiſht the Author's Juſtification had been maintained from ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Medium, than that its lawful to ſwear Allegiance or Fidelity to a King <hi>de facto,</hi> though he may want a civil Right to the Eſtabliſhment of his Throne: And for ſuch who out of meer Conſcience to their former Oath, cannot do ſo much, I wiſh them <hi>(Salvo juri regni)</hi> as much Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence as I could deſire for thoſe whoſe Conſciences are gauled (though the Caſes be vaſtly different) by the Yoak of Conformity in Matters of Religion. To perſwade which I can urge no better Arguments than what <hi>Charles</hi> II. alledges to this purpoſe, and with which I ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, <hi>viz. [We do conjùre all our loving Subjects to acquieſce and ſubmit to this our Declaration concerning thoſe Differences which have ſo much diſquieted the Nation at home, and have given ſo much offence to the Proteſtant Churches abroad, and brought ſo much Reproach upon the Proteſtant Religion in general from the Enemies thereof.]</hi>

The one is done, we'd hope the other ſhall not be left undone; ſharper Medicines may rake the Patient, ſeldom cure the Diſtemper.

                  </note> Manners of the Clergy call for a ſtrict Inſpection, being by far the greateſt Nuiſance in the Church. 'Tis true, our earneſt wiſh is, that the Grievances of Conformity might be redreſt, that many whoſe deſire it is to worſhip God in Spirit and in Truth, may with greater chearfulneſs Labour in his Vineyard: Nor can we with leſs importunity plead that the grand Miſchief of Debauchery, eſpecially in the Clergy, may be provided againſt: We may clamber high to pluck off ſome wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered Branches; but if a Root of Bitterneſs yet remains, our Church will be accounted but a degenerate Plant.</p>
               <p>There's Nitre enough in our Diſcipline, were it duly executed to cleanſe our Garments, and to take out the Spots in our Feaſts.</p>
               <p>The Church ſtands in need of ſweeping, and its Floor of a through purging,<note place="margin">14 <hi>Levit.</hi> 39, 41.</note> but the Walls moſt eminently want ſcraping too, to free it from that fretting Leproſie, which as it hath been the blemiſh, ſo it will (if not effectually cured) prove the bane of it. To prevent which, I believe a ſtrict Reformation of the Univerſities might do much, for the Sin of thoſe young Men is great: And had we no better Argument than that of ſupplanting the Deſign and Project of our Romiſh Enemies (who thought upon this Anvile to hammer out our Ruine) it were ſtrong e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to recommend the Preſcription; were Salt caſt into thoſe Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, they would ſend forth more wholeſome Streams, and ſuch as would make glad the City of our God, giving leſs trouble to our Governours to correct the Errors of the firſt Concoction, for 'tis hard to take out a Fuſt which a Veſſel hath contracted from ſo early a Taint. If theſe Grafts get a Surfeit in the Nurſery, they ſeldom thrive, when they are planted out into the Church, or bring forth any Fruit unto Holineſs.</p>
               <p>Theſe Societies have been very circumſpect as to the Mint and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of Religion, minute and nice in the Form of their Devotion; the Men of <hi>Athens</hi> being in all things very Ceremonious, whilſt their Diſcipline hath been too lax and looſe in puniſhing Debauchery, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting the Practice of Sobriety, and Power of Religion: But will that Coin be current from the exactneſs of the Stamp which is made of em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſed Mettal, and reprobate Silver?

And though too many of the Diſſenters have been unjuſtly clamorous, and turned their Backs upon us, where they might have communicated with us; yet I am confident but Immoralities have been the great drag to which we may Sacrifice for our Schiſm, for had we ſeparated the Precious from the Vile, our Mouth would have been as the Lord's Mouth to them, nor would ſo many have ſeparated from us, had we divided from them: Who to attone their Extravagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, ſtickled high for Conformity, and zealouſly ſtifled againſt all that diſſented, fulfilling the Words of the Prophet,<note place="margin">7 Mich. 2, 3.</note>

It being hard to take off the ancient Grudge againſt them, whilſt ſo deep Revenues run waſte, whoſe Streams might refreſh the City of God; nor can I rationally fall under the Diſpleaſure of any other of the Brethren, ſeeing the deſign of this Plea is only to ſmooth the ways of Conformity, and to make thoſe Paths ſtreight, that the Church's Yoak may become more eaſie, and burthen-light: And can truly proteſt in the Words of a great Perſon,<note place="margin">Bellar, recog.</note> as to the whole of this Diſcourſe, <hi>viz.

This no more than Promotion comes from the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> nor from the <hi>Weſt,</hi> nor from the <hi>South,</hi> it is God that pulls down one with his proud and high Looks, and ſets up, or exalts the humble and meek.

               <p>But why then doth not Righteouſneſs cover the Land as the Waters cover the Sea?

Were it not more for God's Honour to have Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion flouriſh over the Face of the whole Earth, and prophaneneſs to have no place to flee to, or fix the Sole of its Foot upon?</p>
               <p>This indeed is a thing too deep for us, a <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> we ſcarce know how to ſolve. Were it not better that the falſe and lying Tongue were deſtroy'd, and Perjury pluckt up by the Roots, by which Juſtice and Truth have been perverted, guiltleſs Perſons murthered, and innocent Blood ſpilt like Water upon the Ground?

               <p>This hath been the Lord's doing we know, and 'tis marvellous in our Eyes: His Ways are unſearchable, and his Paths are paſt finding out: Not that we deſign to preſcribe Methods to the Providence of God, or Rules and Meaſures to his Wiſdom in the Government of the Church; yet we may pray that all things may be diſpoſed, ſo as they may beſt conduce to his own Glory, the Purity, Peace and Union of that Communion: That having recovered its Light, when it was ſo nigh a total and perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Eclipſe, it may ſhine forth with greater Glory, and diſplay bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Beams of Light, and Love than ever. We may pray that God would bleſs his Majeſty with perfect Victory and Succeſs, that he may ſet his Foot upon the Necks of his Enemies abroad, as well as at home: And that when he is ſettled with Peace round about, he may then think of God's Houſe, how he may heal the Breaches and repair the Decays which Sin and Schiſm have made in the midſt of it. That he would pleaſe to renew the Powers and Faculties to ſuch reverend Fathers of the Church (if expired) as are beſt qualified to ſew up the rent in the Spouſes Vail, and ſo promote the Peace and Glory of our Church. That he would pleaſe ſo far to interpoſe his Authority, as (in a legal way) to procure ſuch Eaſe and Liberty in the ſcrupled part of Conformity, that the weary within the Church may be at reſt: As alſo ſo wide a Door to thoſe who are without, that if they will not enter, it may be truly ſaid, that their excluſion is of themſelves.</p>

               <p>As to our Duty of preventing Diſturbance, and preſerving Peace and Union in the Church. May our Indulgence be meaſured by our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Endeavours to avoid the one and maintain the other: We have with Patience ſubmitted, not for Wrath, but Conſcience ſake, to the Commands of our Superiors: We have bowed the Neck to an uneaſie Yoak, earneſtly ſupplicating the Divine Majeſty to ſend a <hi>Moſes</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver us from thoſe Burthens, which we have received ſo many Solemn and Royal Promiſes ſhould never oppreſs nor grieve us, whilſt we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved our ſelves peaceably under the Civil Government and Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Land.</p>

When the Declaration for Indulgence was commanded to be publiſht by us in our Churches, we did not, we durſt not ſubmit, though we thereby forfeited the Favour, and eminently incurred the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure of a Potent Monarch bigotted to the Romiſh Religion, in whoſe Hands we were, and to be uſed by him at his Pleaſure.</p>
               <pb n="85" facs="tcp:49816:52"/>
               <p>We could have very much rejoiced in a due Enlargement, but we ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kept within our Incloſure, than brake the Hedges and lay the Fences waſte to obtain it: I mean a general Violation of the Canons and Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricks of the Church, the enacted Laws and Statutes of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth: Relying in the mean time upon the Goodneſs and Providence of God, wholly ſubmitting our ſelves to his Will, hoping that he would ſo far move the Hearts of our Rulers in due time, and in a regular way to hear our Complaints, and redreſs our Grievances: And that which puts weight into this Ballance is that too many of thoſe who clamoured high, and made<note n="(a)" place="margin">Who were fierce Deſpiſers of thoſe that were good heady high minded Traytors, having a Form of Godlineſs, but deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Power of it, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.3.5.</note> a great noiſe for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to the Rituals of the Church, baiting and ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring any whom they ſuppoſed guilty of the leaſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and omiſſion of their Duty in that reſpect, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting themſelves the white Boys, and only Sons of the Church, yet were the firſt that turn'd colour, and became Red-letter'd Men (divers of which both of the Clergy and Laity I could name, but I ſpare them) and are at this day living and looking for a day to retrieve their loſt Cauſe: They ſtill retaining thoſe Spots, and Crimſon Tincture they received from the Scarlet whore, which they reſolve no Nirre either of Scripture or Reaſon ſhall ever take out: Whilſt ſuch as they accounted, and traduced as Betrayers of our Church, ſtuck cloſe, maintain'd their Poſts, and in the day of Tryal proved faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and true to its Intereſt.</p>
               <p>We continued conſtant in the Exerciſe of our Miniſtry, fortifying our People committed to our Care, uſing the beſt Arguments we could (join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with our own Examples) to continue in the Communion of our Church, and to ſtand faſt in the open and zealous Profeſſions and Defence of the Faith once delivered to the Saints; comforting, and (to the beſt of our skill) building them up in it, notwithſtanding the Threats and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces we met with, from the profeſt and rampant Enemies of our Church and Religion.</p>

               <p>As for thoſe who in the Day of Temptation went out from us, becauſe they were not of us, we heartily pitty and pray for them, and for their reduction to the Communion from whence they departed, that they would be zealous and repent, conſidering from whence they are fallen and return: For which Reaſon we ſhould be willing to uſe all the Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons of our Spiritual Warfare: And they are ſo happy as to fall into an Age, and Hands which deſign no other, we being ſufficiently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd, that a Club may ſooner daſh a Man's Brains out, than beat Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding into his Head.</p>

               <p>Only firſt give me leave to enquire who were the beſt Sons of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and deſerve moſt at her hands: Whether thoſe who when time was were great Sticklers for Conformity in the ſtricteſt manner to all and every of its Rites: Great Amoriſts, and much in love with our Church and Religion, whilſt it lookt plump, and fair to the Eye: But when the Hand of the Lord had toucht it, and was become black by reaſon of Affliction, ſhrunk and ſhrievell'd upon the account of its Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, forſook their firſt Love. Then their Language was, What is thy Beloved more than another Beloved? What's the Church of <hi>England</hi> more than that of <hi>Rome?</hi> Whether I ſay were theſe better Sons of the Church than thoſe, who though perhaps not ſo exactly ſatisfied with all and every thing that's injoined, yet brake not the Communion of it? But buckling on the Helmet, and being girt about with Truth, were ſteddy and valiant in her moſt dangerous Conflict.</p>
               <p>The other are fit to be Members of that Church, whereof outward Proſperity is the Mark and Character; who ſo long as ours was trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant, it had no greater pretended Votaries and Zealots than themſelves: But theſe Dive-dopping Plant-Animals, dropping from the Tree upon which they grew, and falling into the Waters of <hi>Tiber,</hi> or Sea of <hi>Rome,</hi> preſently ſet up for <hi>Solon-geeſe,</hi> mightily gagling for their eſpouſed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: Who having learnt the Romiſh Cant from their new Dictators, we are ridiculed and lampooned by them in every <hi>Tavern</hi> and <hi>Coffee-houſe,</hi> the bottom of whoſe Diſhes and Glaſſes they better underſtood than the Reaſon of their Change, and new-faſhioned Religion. Then they had the Face and Brow to tell us, that the Church they once ſo much clamo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for, was till an Age or two paſt a <hi>Duck under water:</hi> By whom the firſt (and trite) queſtion we were uſually interrogated upon was, Where was your Religion before <hi>Luther?</hi> To which we have anſwered a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times, and can truly ſay again, that the Platform of it is contained in the Holy Scriptures, which is the only Rule of Faith, and tried Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation upon which our Religion is built: 'Twas inſtituted by Chriſt, pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticed in the Primitive Church, though Tares grew up in the Field; I mean Corruptions in the Boſom of it; and what could not be amended, or endured were neceſſary to be avoided: For we can find (whatever theſe Antiquaries may boaſt of) no Foundation for Purgatory, Prayers for the Dead, or in a Tongue the People underſtand not, no Warrant to direct them to Saints as the Object, no Exemption of the Bleſſed Virgin from original Sin, or Communion celebrated by halfs, or in one kind, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in all that which muſt be the Rule of our Faith and Worſhip: From the beginning theſe things were not ſo. Now if our Religion agree with the Primitive Rule of Faith, and Practice of the moſt ancient Church, 'tis I am ſure before theirs; which hath been often made appear by the beſt records of Antiquity, and Evidences of Scripture: So that we are
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:49816:53"/>at no loſs to tell them, where our Church was before <hi>Luther,</hi> and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion we profeſs, though it was ſometimes Subterranea, and fore'd to hide it ſelf in the Clefts of the Rocks; our <hi>Duck</hi> (if they will have it ſo) was ſometimes fain to dive, being often hunted and purſued by the <hi>Romiſh Spaniels,</hi> thoſe inſatiable Blood-hounds. We can very well tell where our Religion was of old (which is that which Chriſt planted and delivered to the Saints:) But alas, like the Spouſe fallen into ill hands, which wounded her, and took her Vail from her, yea deflowred and defiled her: But it hath pleaſed God to deliver her, and ſave her, and us too out of the hands of our Enemies, that we might ſerve him more purely. In ſhort, Chriſt was both the Author and Finiſher of our Faith, not <hi>Luther</hi> not <hi>Calvin,</hi> though we are very much obliged to them for putting us in a way to cleanſe the Veſſels of our Sanctuary, and ſcowre off the Ruſt they had contracted.</p>
               <p>But if Antiquity be neceſſary to legitimate the Doctrine of Faith, what was the Romiſh Faith; I mean their new framed Articles in their firſt Edition?

That their Yoak may be made more eaſie, and burthen-light: Nay they have not been only faithful to the Church, but are true to the State too: Time was when they were repreſented at Court, as no Friends to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and that it was not for the King's profit to ſuffer them: But now their Crime is, they are of exceſſive Loyalty, and too fond of their Prince. But can we love him too well, who ſeeing the Nation ſinking, or in a violent Storm, labouring for Life, caſt himſelf into thoſe mighty Waters, reſolving ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſink with it, or ſave it? which he effectually did: Who when the Breach was made in our Bank, and the See of <hi>Rome</hi> (I mean Popery) breaking in a man upon us, like <hi>Moſes</hi> ſtood in the Gap, ſtopt the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, drained the Church, and hath made it once again <hi>terra firma.</hi> Time was when Judgment ran down as Waters, but they were very bitter, and and Righteouſneſs as a mighty Stream, but like an overflowing Scourge bore down Juſtice, and common Right before it; for Judgment was
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:49816:55"/>turned into Gall, and the Fruit of Righteouſneſs into Wormwood; which occaſioned many bitter Cries and Complaints among us: But now our <hi>Sion</hi> is redeemed with Judgment, and her Converts with Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Now we have no Youths from <hi>Doway</hi> or St. <hi>Omers</hi> to confront the Truth, or ſupport a Lye: No awing of Judges, packing of Juries, or forcing of Verdicts. We have found a Prince that ſeeks Judgment and relieves the oppreſſed, and can we then be too fond, can we love him too well? Who by the Councel and Conſent of Parliament hath eaſed our Proteſtant Brethren without the Church, yea hath framed a Project to remove the Grievances of thoſe which are within too, having grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Powers and Commiſſions, to many wiſe and worthy Members of it to review our Liturgy, to inſpect our Eccleſiaſtical Polity, to remove the Stumbling-blocks, and to take away the Rocks of offence, to the uniting both in the ſame Communion, and common Intereſt (which 'tis highly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable it might in time effect;) and may he never give over till he hath perfected the Work, and cut it ſhort in Righteouſneſs. How then can we but love him, yea and moſt earneſtly pray for him? that God would bleſs him at home and abroad, by Sea and Land, in Peace and War, that his Head may be covered in the Day of Battel, that no Weapon form'd againſt him may proſper, that he may put an Hook into the Noſtrils, and Bridle into the Mouth of that great Oppreſſor, who would lay Houſe to Houſe, Field to Field, till there be no room left upon the Earth; That he may return home with triumph, when he ſhall have reſtored Liberty, and procured Right to be done to the diſtreſſed Princes and States of <hi>Europe;</hi> as he hath already done for the People of <hi>England,</hi> to which all honeſt Men, and true <hi>Engliſh</hi> Men will ſay. <hi>Amen.</hi>

            <p>BUT before I lay my Pen down, may I aſſume the liberty a little, to argue and expoſtulate with you our Diſſenting Brethren and Friends; I bear you record you have a Zeal of God, which I wiſh may never want the juſt Meaſures of Sincerity, Truth and Knowledge: But when I obſerve in you a total Separation and univerſal Departure from our Communion; and yet not only to allow our Communion but fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it in others; yea in Matters of greateſt ſcruple in ſome urgent caſes practice it your ſelves, it is a thing too hard for me. I have known ſome who have ſuffered themſelves to be deprived both of their Offices and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices by the <hi>Bartholomew</hi> Act, yet have ſent their Children to our Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities, where the ſtricteſt Conformity is uſed, and injoin'd the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of thoſe Societies, yea have afterwards put them into the Prieſt's Office, which for Conſcience ſake they could not ſubmit to execute themſelves. Many have been elected into places of Magiſtracy, and other Imployments, and how ſtanch ſoever they have been before and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: Yet to avoid the Dint and Penalty of the Law, have given a yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to the Commands, and Authority of the Church, ſubmitting to thoſe Rites, which at other times they ſcruple, yea renounce. But why do you condemn your ſelves in the things you can upon occaſion admit? Can you diſpenſe with your Conſciences to ſerve a turn? Doth not this juſtifie the Practice of our Romiſh Adverſaries, who can licenſe themſelves to take Oaths, to hold a Conformity with the Church, or diſſemble a Compliance to cheat their Rulers, and avoid the Dint and Penalty of the Law? If you can conform, and hold Communion with the Church in Praying, Heating and Receiving the Holy Sacrament, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for the Preſervation of your ſelves? Why not then for the Preſervation of Peace, and Unity in the Church? I need not tell you how miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous a thing Schiſm is, or how deep a Stain, and guilt it leaves behind it upon the Conſcience. Is it not a poſitive and plain Command to be ſubject to the higher Powers, to ſubmit to every Ordinance of Man for
